# Boneless-Wings-Campaign

Group Expectations
What are our group goals for this project? What do we want to accomplish?

Create a cohesive campaign advocating stance that boneless wings aren’t chicken nuggets
Utilize Facebook, Twitter and Website
Baseline: Create logo, cover photo, website and at least one social media “ad graphic” as part of campaign
Aspirational: Additional Facebook posts and tweets as part of campaign (i.e. Twitter polls, GIFS, etc.), potentially a YouTube video, additional “ad graphics”


What quality of work do we expect from each group member, and what strategies will we employ to ensure that we fulfill these standards?

Everyone shares an equal workload and make a conscious effort to incorporate writer/designer elements (i.e. contrast, alignment, balance, etc.)
Send a draft to each other for approval by at least one other person in the group


How will we encourage ideas from all team members?

First 5-10 minutes of class is designated workshop time to present progress and get feedback from other team members
Create a GroupMe for communication outside of class

Group Procedures 

Will we need to meet outside of class? If so, what will be the dates, times, and locations of meetings? 

Does not seem likely that we will need to outside of class, if so we will plan and communicate an extra meeting in GroupMe


What is the preferred method of communication for sharing information about meetings, updates, reminders, and problems? Possibilities include email, text, GitHub issue queue (see below), Slack, Google Hangout, etc

GroupMe for basic communication 
GitHub for sharing drafts


Consider how much of this communication you'll want to be able to turn to for evidence of collaboration or fodder for your unit / semester reflections

Personal Accountability

Define each team member's expected level of responsibility for attending meetings, responding to communication from other group members, and completing assigned tasks on time.

If you are going to miss class then let the other team members know and send an update/draft pushed through GitHub, and try to have your phone on you to answer questions via GroupMe

If a group member needs help or has questions via GroupMe, be courteous about responding

Have drafts for the checkpoints and have updates (either tangible or in the form of an idea) each class

Describe how the group will handle a team member who does not comply with the contract. What are the consequences?
Talk to Ben

Further considerations

If you will use GitHub for collaboration, whose account will host the repo? 

Eli


What shared filespace will you use for our group? Does everyone in your group have editing access to it?

Github repo shared with everyone 






Project Proposal

Introduction/summary. This will update the project pitch. Can you write yourselves a more specific assignment, now that you know what project you're on and who's on the team?

Our plan for our project is to create a social media campaign stating that boneless wings are not the same thing as chicken nuggets. We will use Facebook, Twitter and also create our own website in order to host these social media accounts. The plan is to create a logo, a header image, and one advertisement image that we will be able to post on our social media accounts. An aspirational goal would be to create a YouTube video that we could post on all platforms. 


Project plan. What tech will you use? Where will you source any necessary assets? How will you combine your separate efforts? Build in some flexibility, e.g. through stretch goals.

We’ll have a basic html website for basic information and utilize social media sites like Facebook and Twitter as well. For visual aspects like a logo, background header, adverts, etc. we’ll use Gimp/Photoshop to create original images. We’ve divided the workload based on interest and placed goal dates in the timeline. Hosted on GITHUB. 


Justification. Given the motivation and goals in your intro, how will the plan actually accomplish it? What Digital Media Composing skills will you be leveling up on?

We mainly want to expand on what we learned in the visual unit, as well as the website unit. Creating the logo, cover photo, and advertisement will let us have more experience using GIMP/photoshop. The social media accounts are something new that we have yet to explore in our class so far. Through working as a group, we can gain experience in a digital media that we haven’t have time to have a unit on in class. Hosting all of our social media on a website gives us the opportunity to use and expand on our use of HTML/CSS.


Roles and responsibilities. How will you divide up the pieces of the plan? How will you know if the work's been done satisfactorily? This will update and/or include your team contract.

We will divide up the work primarily based on media types and expertise. Sammie and Eli will be tackling the visual graphics using GIMP/photoshop and Taylor will work on the website. We plan to evaluate our team halfway through to see if we can add in a YouTube campaign video as well. Everyone plans to collaborate on overall messaging, with Eli and Sammie taking initiative on drafting Facebook and Twitter posts for our feeds. 

We will know if the work’s been done satisfactorily if everyone from the group approves of the final product (this should be done before posting/making any final drafts public.)
